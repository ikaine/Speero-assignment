## Time spent on the task

3h 39min

## Most difficult part

* Having had to improvse how to run the files on an online site proved to be a challenge as I haven't had any experience with any tools to solve this issue. Finally I decided to use Google Chrome browser developer tools to run the script and css after the page load.
* The 3rd change proved to be the most time-consuming task. This is most likely becaus it has been a while since I last used scripts to fetch data from an API. So I had to rewrite the code a few times to fire the popup creation script after all the external data had been loaded.
